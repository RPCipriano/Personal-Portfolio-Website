                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>
                    Hi, my name is Rodrigo Cipriano and I'm 24 years young and I'm from Lisbon, Portugal! <br>
                    I consider myself as a self-didact and an ambitious young men! <br>
                    Since early I felt attract to enginnering, because of the possibilities to create great things using simple objects. The idea that you could use simple blocks and piled them up
                    to create a wall, or putting pieces together and create a LEGO truck it was amazing to me! <br>
                    Since then, I've build a educational path to learn what I needed to become an Engineer! After 12 years of school and 5 years of college, I've reach a point where I can 3D module HVAC buildings and,
                    I can finally understand, what I felt when I was just builind Legos! <br>
                    In the beggining of 2021, I started working at Layout.Lda as a Project Design Trainee and as I finished my Bachelors Degree, in late 2023, I became a Project Mechanical Enginner
                    specialised in BIM models and BIM enviroment! <br>
                    One year later, I decided to get more knowledge in Web Development and Web Design and try to understand everything I needed to take a step into this unlimited world.
                    </p>
